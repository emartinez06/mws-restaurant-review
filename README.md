#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

### Problem

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Work Done

Page wasn't very responsive. Little tweaks on the CSS were made so it can be responsive as possible on different viewports (Mobiles, Desktops, etc). Page also can be accessed by screen readers following the recommendations from the WCAG standards (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). Page can be browseable even in offline mode.

### How to test it?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. XAMPP from Apache Friends has a good tool with all necessary to run a web server locally. You can get it from here: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html.

2. After set it up, open your browser and point out to the project like this" http://127.0.0.1/mws-restaurant. if you're using the Google Maps API, make sure that your API key can receive requests from localhost, otherwise you will receive a rejection response.

3. Done. Now you can debug the page locally.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
